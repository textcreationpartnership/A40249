            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> Sheweth how the Lord is King of the whole Earth; and all Kings and Emperors have got up since the Apostles dayes among Christians; and of true Maintenance and true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry; And something concerning such as serve not the Lord Jesus Christ but their own Bellies.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord is King of the whole Earth, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all power in Heaven and Earth to the Son, and hath made him Judge of the quick and the dead, and hath committed all Judgement to the Son, and all things is to be done in the Sons Name who hath all power in Heaven and Earth given to him, and that which is to be asked for, is to be asked in the Sons Name: And the Christians were not to do things in the Name of an Earthly King, or Emperour, or Protector, but that which they did, they were to do it in the Name of Christ, who hath all power in Heaven and Earth given to him, who was to subject all Rule and Authority to himself, in whose Name things was to be done. And the Apostles said they was to set up the least in the Church to judge of outward things; so the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up these Kings, and Emperours, and Protectors, and giving them the Names Excellency and Majesty amongst the Christians, hath been since the dayes of the Apostles among the Apostates in the Apostacy from the true Wisdom of God and Life. And so the Pope hath taken the Tenths of peoples Estates to the Church, and he hath taken the Tenths of Tenths; and so the people have been willing in the times of Ignorance (in the Apostacy) to offer it up that they might merit by it (though the Bishops lands was not Tythable.) And so when they had gotten the peoples Tenths, and the Pope the Tenth of Tenths, after a while they claimed it by a Law, by the Authority and higher Powers (so called) which the Pope had invented; and when they did not Pay it, they would take treble of them, or cast into prison, or both. And when the Pope which had the Tenth of Tenths in <hi>England</hi> was denied, the Kings took Tenth of Tenths, and then they sold the Tythes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109879:4"/> to the Impropriators, and giving them a Law to take it and treble if they would not give it them. And now people, what is your free Gift come to? which in times of Ignorance and Darkness was given to merit by; and the Heads took it under pretence of merit; and now they have set it up by a Law, and take treble, and cast into prison till death if they will not give it them. So when the Kings that denied the Pope took the Tenth of Tenths, the Popes Wages that was Head of the Church, and when the Kings died, the Protector took Tenth of Tenths, and he was the Head; So thus they have taken away the peoples Estates in the time of their Ignorance; So they have taken that which people did expect to merit by; and they that gives Tenths, gives that which people did expect to merit by giving it to the Church, and they that take Tythes, take that which people did expect to merit by: Now they that took Tythes under the Law before Christ came in the flesh, the Tenth of Tenths, the Chief Magistrate did not go away with it, it was given for <hi>Levi</hi> and the Priests, the Widows, Strangers, and Fatherless; so the Protestants are not reformed from the Popes maintenance to the Tribe of their black-Coats, nor reformed from their Popish-Houses and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges by which they make Ministers, and where they teach; them who are reformed cannot pay the Tenths to that they call the Holy Church, and its Ministry, Protestants, nor Papists, for they know they merit nothing by it. And why do ye make a Law that none must speak to the Priests, or ask them a Question going or coming from the Steeple-houses, or in it, and yet make a Law that all must maintain them, all must give them Tythes, and so all must maintain them with Tythes or Easter-Reckonings? Is this equal, and according to Reason? Did not Christ send forth his Teachers like Sheep among Wolves? and he exhorted them to take no thought what they should speak, take no purse, told them they should be brought before Rulers and Magistrates, should be scourged in the Synagogues, had before Counsels, and told them that a Sparrow did not fall to the ground without the will of their Heavenly Father, and that the hairs of their heads were numbered; And the Disciples might have said, We (some of us) have Wives and Children, and thou sends us among Wolves; what will become of our Wives and Children? As our Priests cry now, who dare not go out among Christians now
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109879:4"/> without a bag or yearly Stipend, or Tythes, or both; and Christ sent forth his Disciples amongst Wolves, and they were not to provide, but they were to enquire who were worthy, and into what house they went, what was set before them they were to eat, and when they came back again to Christ, he asked them if <hi>they had wanted any thing?</hi> and they said, <hi>No:</hi> So these wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that went out among the Wolves and came back again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to Christ: But these cannot say so, that go out among Christians, for they cast into prison them they do no work for, for their maintenance; but these cryes Wants, wants, to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and Parliaments, and Courts. So this was the Law of Christ, they was not to take care what to speak afore-hand, they was not to provide for the maintenance for the Ministry, nor they were not to take thought what to speak, they were not to study, they were to love Enemies, they were not to hate them as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did before them; they were not to swear, but they were to keep to Yea and Nay in their Communication, for the <hi>Jewes</hi> had sworn before them; Now the Priests and Professors are the first-born of the flesh that persecute them that are born of the Spirit, and they that be in the flesh cannot please God; and so them that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as they do now persecute that lives out of Christ Jesus and talk of his words. And so all the Professors and Teachers in the whole Christendom that are so full of rage, bitterness, and persecution, and have not the humility, they must not have the honour. And so all the Teachers are now made manifest that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison, and persecute, and spoyl mens Goods that they do no Work for, to be such as Preach Peace to People while they do put into their mouths, who now prepare War against such as do not put into their mouths, whether he hear them or not hear them; whether he Teacheth them or not Teacheth them; if he put not into their mouths they will prepare war against him. And they that are carnally minded is death, of which death the Devil is the power of, who acts under him as an engagement to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of his lust, which do persecute Friends, when as if they should do the Will of Christ who destroyes the Devil, they should love their Enemies; but such minding Earthly things are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Crosse of Christ who serve not the Lord Jesus Christ but their own bellies; who will serve you if give them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109879:5"/> Tythes, Augmentations, Gleab-lands, Mortuaries, Easter-reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onings, Midsummer-dues, but take them away they will not serve you.</p>

            <p>And thus the Kings of the Earth band themselves, and the Princes are assembled together against the Lord and his Christ, Let us break their bands a sunder and cast their cords from us, He that dwell in the Heavens shall laugh them to scorn, the Lord shall have them in derision, the Lord shall speak to them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure, saying to these Kings and Princes, <hi>I have set my King upon Sion my holy mountain, Psal.</hi> 2. <hi>Melchesedeck</hi> king of <hi>Salem</hi> Prince of Peace, before the Law he was a figure of Christ, The King, the Prince of Life that

            <p>OH how have you dishonoured the Truth, Oh how have you dishonoured the Name of God, Oh how have you made the Gospel chargeable? Oh how have you lost your Glory, your Glory is made void? Oh how have ye dispised the Crosse of Christ, and gloried in your shame, and served not the Lord Jesus Christ, but your own bellies? Oh how long have you made a trade of the Prophets, Apostles and Saints words, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny suffer that be in the life by you, and stockt, whipt, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, imprisoned? Oh how have you made a trade of these words, and whipt, and persecuted, and prisoned, scoft and mockt, and reproached the elect of God, the Saints, such as be in the Spirit of God that gave forth Scriptures? Oh ye professors,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109879:11"/> professing Magistrates, and Teachers, where is Truth now to be found, in your Goales, in your houses of correction, in your stocks? theres the place now for People to look for Truth, for the Ministers of unrighteousness that serve not the Lord Jesus Christ but their own bellies, that teach for filthy lucre, and the professing Magistrates that they ride upon, will let Truth have no place among them, accept it be in their Goales, houses of correction, stocks, or prisons? Oh shameless men! What ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock have you made of the Saints goods, what spoyling of them? but now <hi>Iobs</hi> patience comes to be known; what wolves do you appear in sheeps cloathing, ravening, Worrying, Tearing in whole Families, such as ye do no work for, a right Wolfe, Let the Goales, the Prisous in your Counties make them manifest, yet do you pretend to teach people, to keep Lectures up and down to blind People, to blind the Country, think you not that they see you; that if the Countrey people did not put into your mouthes, and the Magistrates give you maintenance and dinners at your Lectures, that you would be a company of dumb sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, a company like them that <hi>Isaiah</hi> spake of, will you bark without they give you augmentations, your Easter-reckonings, Tithe-piggs and Geese, and Hay, &amp;c. And Gleab-lands? nay will you sing without money, Pray without money? You make trades of the Saints words, Prophets words, by the hour-glasse, that is your measure, and when the glasse is run, time is spent neighbours, is it not the light make all these things manifest, and the day come that you cannot be hid, &amp; that all your preaching and all your fair words, and fair speeches, your actions make you to stink in the Countrey, plundering people you do no work for, as bad as ever the Caviliers or rather worse, for they did but take their goods away, &amp; you pretend for a worship, and cast into prison besides; you be them that serve not the Lord Jesus Christ but your own bellies, for if you served Christ, he would teach you no such Doctrine, no such Practices; Therefore O ye wells without water, Clouds without raine, ye wandering Stars, for whom is reserved the blakness of darknesse; the spoyling of the Saints goods, the casting men into prison can not seperate them from the Lord Jesus Christ, nor the powers, nor the principalities, nor all the Ministers of unrighteousnesse that robs for their bellies, and plunders and steales and takes of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109879:11"/> them that hears them not? Oh wo and misery is your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and lamentable is your state! Ye shall come to wish it had been better ye had never been born, and ye had better a lived without this making a spoyl of the people of Gods goods, for it will sink you all; was not the Pope the first author of Goals and prisons, he your example, was not he the first author of Tythes, Easter-reckenings, and Midsummer-dues, he the first author of making a trade of the Scriptures, and killing the Saints, and making a trade of their words; But the Lord God is come, who will be avenged of you; O ye shepherds! howling must come among you, and principal of the flock, you have made a prey on the people, ye divine to them for money, ye have taught them for filthy lucre, ye have born rule among them for meanes, ye preach to them while they put into your mouthes, ye preach to them for the fleece, in the cloudy dark day, night of Apostacy since the Apostles dayes; your tents are wicked, your habitation is darknesse, the fruits appears, the Goales may witnesse, your vineyards are wildernesses, lye like a wildernesse, a howling wildernesse, your trees are corrupt, your bottles are full of the old Wine, which burst with the new; your candle is put out, therefore you cannot believe in the light that enlightens every man that cometh into the World, your darkness cannot comprehend it, the day of many of your visitations will be over, the Sun over you set, and you shall be confounded, and your wisdom shall be turned backward, and you cannot deceive people much longer; your folly is made manifest, you make it manifest to all men; and your cruelty, your unmercifulnesse, your hard heartednesse, your spoyling the Saints goods, who quite live without the fear of God, as if you had never heard talk of God, the Church, Prophets, Apostles or Christ Jesus the Son of God, for they are not your examples, but such as be out of Truth: Therefore such as Teach for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucre, for the fleece, for the means, for the gaine from their quarter, that divine for money, such never served the People of God, but the People of God cryed against, that lived in his fear; But they served covetous, and they served perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors and earthly minded ones, that lives in transgression out of the power of God? Therefore you that feel after the Lord God, come out from among them, least you be partakers of their

Therefore all you blinde guides, ye blinde leaders, ye blinde watchmen, whose deeds are not wrought in God, who hate the light and will not come to it because your deeds be evil, and love the darkness rather then the light, whose works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse break open, and cannot be hid, who would keep all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the light, and hate it as your selves do, and so to keep them blind that they should not see, like the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> shut up the Kingdom of Heaven from men, would not go in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves nor suffer others, and so would keep people from the light which Christ have enlightened them withall, that they should not see your deeds; but that is your condemnation that hate it, and love the darknesse rather, and will not come to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it will reprove them; In that the Saints walk over your heads, which condemn you in that they have unity in the light which brings to the day, by which all the Saints be made manifest and seen, <hi>Praises &amp; Glory to the Lord God for ever,</hi> in which the Saints have Unity and can sing <hi>Halilujah,</hi> the Lord Omnipotent reigns; away with all your formal preaching, singing, formal sprinkling, and Sacraments, away with your luke-warmnesse, professors and Teachers, who have long served God and Christ with your lips, but your hearts far from him; away with the traditions of men and rudements of the World, and commandments and Doctrines of men; away with your worldly Church, old Mass houses, the Church is in God, (<hi>Thes.</hi> 1.) Away with your singing, and preaching, and praying for money by the hour-glasse; Away with your feigned humilitie, will-worship, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall speaking and teaching; The Lord Gods indignation is kindled against you, all professors and Teachers of the Saints, Prophets, Apostles and Sons words, out of the life found, that will prison to death for your bellies; Is this the end of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109879:12"/> Is this the end of your profession, Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie? Do it all end for that which is for the mouth and your bellies?

            <head>That the Powers of the Earth may see how the People of God suffer, and are persecuted and Imprisoned to Death, and Goods spoyled; and all this done in the name of the Higher Power.</head>
            <p>ALL you Powers of the Earth, is not this enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, the hardest hearted of you all, to see the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the People of God under your Authority, and your Priests that does no work for them, their patient suffering till death imprisonment, because they will not pay the Priests Tythes, and because they will not swear, and will not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the Lord Jesus Christs commands, their goods spoyled, they come against with Clubs, with Swords, the Priests Bailiffes driving away their cattel and goods, taking away so much as their Plow-geare, whereby many Families are almost ruined, and this they patiently suffer; and so the Priests say the Higher power granted them treble damage; and the Higher power cast them into prison because they will not swear to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers: Mark and consider, you are them that bear all, the Saints sufferings will fall upon you; For the Priests cry you give them power to take treble damage, and then they take treble and treble, so then they cry it is the Law that give them treble and treble from them they do no work for, nor never heard them; Is not this unreasonable, would you that be in the Authority be served so your selves? How many hundreds and thousands have been prisoned, and fined in this Nation, and their goods spoyled, and many imprisoned to death, and never lift up a hand against any, and never found in plots nor contrivances against this power that prisoned them, but under it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109879:13"/> suffer patiently; Now if this be not enough to convince you, what will? And your hearts are hardened, words will not, but now it must be the sufferings of the Just; did ever Lambes, or Sheep make such havock of beasts as the Priests and Powers, the bad Magistrates have made of the people of God in this age? did ever any of the people of God lift up a hand against any man, Or any of them that you in scorn call Quakers, that you will scarce let have any room on the Earth? But in stocks, Prisons, Cages or Goales, or Houses of correction, and yet spoyl their goods, and make havock of them? Have ye Taxes? have ye Excise? Have ye means for your poor? Priests take five or six times value of what he claimes, and his Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and his Clark that say Amen, they will cast into prison; And the Priest will cast into prison such as he do no work for; Church-wardens make havock of the goods, and spoyl to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the old Masse-houses, and yet their Teachers must not be spoken to neither going or coming, nor at the Steeple-house, but five pound or six moneths imprisonment; And must not have a question asked him but at this deare rate; Is not this heavier &amp; worse then Queen <hi>Mary?</hi> For they might speak when the Priest had done; Is not your finger heavier then the Papists? And why is it that you suffer the Saints goods to be spoyled, their houses to be torn to pieces, their windows to be broken where they meet together; And why is it you suffer their goods to be straind, for going to meetings the first day of the week, not giving them again? And why is it you suffer your rude people to knock down friends in High-wayes, and Gates, stone them at their meetings, and rend and tear their cloathes off their backs, and yet they patiently suffer it? And pay Taxes to maintaine Authority; their meetings broke up, heads broken, cloathes rent off their backs, squibs of fire thrown at them at their meetings; Mans dung thrown among them, at the faces of them rotten eggs; Windows all tatterd to pieces by Priests people, and many fined because they will not go to the Steeple-house, and many fined for going to the Steeple-house; And is not unmercifulnesse the cloake of People, the Covering and folly and madnesse and blinde zeal; Is this like unto the sheeps doings, these actions before mentioned, and Lambs like unto the flock of Christ, as you name your selves
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109879:13"/> to be? Why do you force people to swear, when Christ saith sware not at all? Why will you be Antichrist against Christ, and persecute them that will do truth at yea and nay, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christs Teaching? Why will you persecute People, and prison them for not paying to the Clarks for their saying Amen, and turning the hour-glasse, and hanging the Pulpit, &amp; such like service? And why do you persecute people for not mending the old mass-houses, who for conscience sake cannot mend the the old Mass-houses, and set up Pictures and Images, as ye may see in London, in that called St. <hi>Sweetings,</hi> and most places? Why do you persecute People for not paying Tythes to the Jesuites tribe of black coats, when Christ said, freely ye have received freely give? Why will you set up a maintenance opposite to Christ, to oppresse people, and tollerate the takers of it under the name of Christs Ministers? Why will you perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute people for crying repentance through your streets, and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people to forsake sin and unrighteousness, and ungodliness, and deceitfull Merchandize? Why will you whip and stock such? And why do you persecute such as Rogues and sturdy Beggers, and whip them that fear God, that are moved to go to visit their friends, or about their occasions travelling, though they be men worth fourty or fifty or eighty pound a year? Is not this a bad savour &amp; a stink? Why will you persecute people for conscience sake that obey the Law of God, and cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect mens persons? Why have you a custom to compel peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to respect persons and commit sin, contrary to the Law of God, and is it not an evil custome? Or else Fourty pound fine if they will not respect persons, or Fourty Mark or more or lesse, and is not this a shame to persecute people to death, because they will not maintain your Ministry, as if you were not able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your Ministry your selves? Is not this to your shame &amp; dishonour of Nobility? And is it not a shame &amp; dishonour like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to Nobility to persecute, spoyl goods, such as will not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your Clerks and mend your house which you meet in, and do not this shew a bad spirit and not the honourable? Why do you let the Popes crosse stand on all your Ships, your Seals and Mases, your weights and measures, your Flags Arms and Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chons? Therefore let all those that take the name upon them of a Minister of Christ, let them not be such as will plunder and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109879:14"/> spoyl and make havock of peoples goods they do no work for; but first let them plant before they eat, get a flock and then milk, thresh and plow, and not such as covets mens silver and gold and apparel, and teach for filthy lucre, and are the strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, wrestlers with flesh and blood; Is not all this prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and whipping about Religion, Church &amp; Ministrie, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship got up among you since the dayes of the Apostles? Is it not time now to awake out of this murderous power, into the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Christ Jesus, and to come to the Lord of Life, and Christ the Wisdom of God which is pure and gentle Lamb-like, that save mens lives, not that which destroyes them; And why do you persecute about dayes, and prison and strain goods, and the Apostle said do not judge one another about such things, the Kingdom of Heaven do not stand in meats nor drinks, nor days, but in Righteousnesse and joy in the Holy Ghost, and in power; who is come to Christ is come to the Lord of the Sabboth; And why do you hate and prison to death and spoyl goods for the Priests, that do no work for them he spoyl? Christ, do not he say love Enemies, why do you hate and persecute to death? Did Christ say one Christian should do so to another? And is this the power of Christ, the Minde of Christ, that you should prison to death for Priests maintenance, and for not swearing Fine, And that you should prison and strain the goods of people that travel to meetings the first day, is it such as break the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? Is this Christ minde? Answer and consider, is this Christs mind that you should imprison and spoyl the goods of such that will not pay Clerks wages for turning the hour-glasse, and such like, and laying the Priest a cushon, and for not mending the old Mass-house, which they call a Temple; Is this Christs minde that these things should be held up? And is it Christs minde now that people should be fined and imprisoned for cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repentance up and down, to warn people to turn from sin and evil, is it Christs minde that people should be fined and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned because they will not swear, and fined and imprisoned because they will not doff their hats, and respect persons, and transgresse the law of God, who have given you this liberty in all these things? Whose minde have this been? Are these the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sheep to come with hills and Swords, and staves and clubs, &amp; strain the peoples goods for a man that do no work for them? Was not this <hi>Iudas</hi> way that thief that carried the bag?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109879:14"/> and is not this the Priests way? Is this the work of the Ministers of Christ that covet no mans Gold nor silver nor appartel, that did not teach for filthy Lucre, will you say that these do not teach for filthy Lucre, that strains the goods of them they do no work for, and prison to death; yet must not these be called Lucre Teachers? And why do you scorn and mock at them that tremble at the word of God, and make a mock of them? Surely your selves is not come to the trembling of Devils, to have him cast out of you, which you must before you come to know the earth shaken wch he compasseth; And why did you put out such as fear God and tremble at the word of God out of the Army, which might have been a blessing to the Lord God in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and for preserving peace and quietness among you? Why did you put out all such Justices as fear the Lord God, that was for the stopping of the vulgar people the Priests rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who knock down in High-ways, that murder in the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houses, that tear, rend Cloathes in pieces, break windows, tear the hair off of mens heads, scoff, mock, stone through streets? Is it not just with the Lord God to vex you, to bring troubles among your selves? Why are you not come to equity? They that will have a hireling let them pay them, and not for other to be compeld to maintaine them, as are taught of God; Did not the Prophets in all ages, and the Apostles testifie against them that taught for filthy Lucre, and the love of mony, coveted mens silver, Gold and apparel, and were strikers, lovers of pleasures, and are these the only men must fit you now, and please you? Did not the Prophets cry against such as did bear rule by their means, and say it was a horrible filthy thing committed in the Land, and such as taught for the fleece, and seek for it, and make a prey upon the people, and such as taught for their gain from their quarter, as were called greedy dumb dogs that could never have enough (<hi>Isaiah</hi> 56,) And are these the only men must fit you now, and your people, that will spoyl the goods so of the people of God (the Saints) that they do no work for, and the Children of God that be taught of God, and follow Christ Jesus; And shall they be your only Teachers that Divine to you for Money, that preach to you for hire, that will preach peace to you while you put into their mouthes, if not prepare war against, and be them that have been the bringers of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109879:15"/> into Ruin, and yet is your eyes closed up, you cannot see; Do not <hi>Micha</hi> tell the heads of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and of <hi>Israel,</hi> that their Judges did Judge for rewards, their Prophets Divine for money, their Priests did teach for hire, was not this the message of <hi>Micha</hi> to the Heads, and did not the Heads allow of these things, their Authority, &amp; was it not contrary to the Power of God, &amp; did not <hi>Micha</hi> say that they should be all brought on Heaps, and their High places of worship like a forest; And shall these be such now that must please you that Christ cryed wo against, such as stand praying in the Synagogues, love salutations in the Markets in their long Robes, in uppermost Rooms at Feasts, which Christ cryed wo against? Are these now they that must fit the People? Usurpers of Authority, of a Ministry made of men without that of God; For where do you read of Master <hi>Paul</hi> or Master <hi>James,</hi> &amp;c. Or who are the men that must fit the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now, but such as the Prophets, Apostles and Christ witnesse against, and the Spirit of the Lord could never bear, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Earth, who is gone on in <hi>Cains</hi> way; Did <hi>Cain</hi> kill <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> his brother about sacrificing, about his worship and Religion, and what have the Apostate Christians since the Apostles dayes kild his brother Christian about Sacrifice and Religion, have not this been the false Church, the great City, the Sacrificer? thats <hi>Cain</hi> that built a City that kil'd his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and what have you kil'd your Brother Christian, <hi>Cain</hi> kil'd his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; False Church since the true Church went into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is not <hi>Cain</hi> a vagabond, and did not the Apostle tell you that you should not go on in <hi>Cains</hi> way, but you should love one another, love is lost, should you not love Enemies, and now poor <hi>Cain</hi> canst thou bear thy punishment, is not thy punishment greater then thou canst bear? have thou kil'd thy Brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, worship, Sacrifice, and because he would not put into thy mouth, give thee maintenance, give thee means; nay because he would not sware, and break Christs command, prison to Death; Is this true Christianity? And the fruits of sheep, of Lambs, and the work in the Wisdom of God, these things fall heavie upon you; And do not the Steeple-houses in this Nation, and the High-wayes, and the Courts, and Goales and houses of Correction, &amp; Towns which are sparkled with the blood of the Innocent satisfie you and convince you, besides
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109879:15"/> what many have suffered to death, this lingering Martyredome, who would wear out the Saints of the most High, and weary them out by sufferings, but the Lord is upholding them by his hand, who can overturn Nations at his pleasure; Before this blood that is spilt in Christendome about Religion, Church Worship and Ministry, and his maintenance, and oppressing People for not respecting persons, and breaking the Commands of Christ be taken off of these Nations, and the blood be revenged, and Inquisition made for it, search made for it, the Author of all things, of spilling of it, sad weight you will feel, and wo and misery will come upon you before the Nation be cleansed of this; Therefore I say, the Innocency, the Patience of the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the People of God, that suffer dayly, examples and paterns among you all, following the Prophets and Christs and the Saints in suffering, may convince you, not threatning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, nor lifting up their hand against you, but committing their cause to the Lord, who do avenge the cause of his People, and will be avenged and overturn untill Righteousnesse be Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished; And while you turn against the Just, and persecute the People of God, you go against the Power of God, in which you should be Established, and so you cannot prosper, until you stop oppression and persecution, and the violence of the unrighteous Ministry, that they shall not spoyl and devour the People of Gods goods; And stop the violence of Judges that they shall not fine and imprison, and make havock of the people that will not respect their persons; And that they shall not be persecuted, and prisoned, and fined, because they will not sware, and break the command of Christ; And stop the violence of the rude mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that they shall not breake the windows, knock down, and beat, bruise, stone the people of God; And that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices shall not encourage the Priests rude people to abuse, to tear Cloathes, to break the heads of the people of God as they walk up and down; And you stop the violence of the bad Magistrates, Mayors, and Balliffs, for whiping honest men of sufficient estates for sturdy Rogues and Beggers, for warning them to feare God, and bidding the Town Repent of wickednesse, Oathes, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennesse, and filthinesse; When you stop these things, then there may be something of your prospering; When you stop the corruptions of Magistrates, Mayors and Bayliffs, that stop such as go to meet together the first day of the week;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109879:16"/> but so long as you suffer such things to be acted, you go in the way to have the Nation ruined; And when you begin to stop the Church-wardens and the Clerks that come to make havock and will cast in prison such as will not give them monie, and spoil their goods though they do nought to them, while you suffer these unrighteous things to be acted in the Nation, it is but like the righteous Power you should deny, and so you not be established.</p>
            <p>Oh when will the Goals &amp; houses of Correction be emptied of the Lambs and Babes and Children of God?

When will you set your Goals open, and free them of the People of God? It is not to be looked for until you come into the mind of Christ, nor expected; and when will you come into that as you long in words have talked on? Oh where is Truth to be looked for now among the bad Magistrates, and the Teachers of unrighteousnesse for filthy lucre, but in their Goals, their Cages, their houses of correction, and in their Stocks? Oh how is this Nation torn and tattered being out of the life and power of God, which should govern, and the Wisdom of God which is pure and gentle from above? How do the earthly, sensual and devilish appear in the highest place of Worship, and chiefest houses of prayer? How do men appear more like Wolves? How do the people appear in sheeps cloathing but in Wolves nature, both professors and Teachers? Is not this sad to behold, and lamentable to look upon?

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109879:16"/> that those should be them that should bend people to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; Do these make worshippers of God in the Spirit and Truth, Goals, Stocks, whips, Prisons, these make wil-worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that are made by Will-worshippers? but it is not the work of them that worship in the Spirit? for the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of the Apostles were Spiritual not carnal, they wrestled not with flesh and blood, but with the powers of darknesse, and spiritual wickednesse in high places, these were the workmen that were not ashamed, that had the spiritual weapons, and these were in the mind of Christ the Prince of life, that destroyed death and the devil the power of it, and come to save mens lives, whose Doctrine was <hi>Love enemies,</hi> but you have disobeyed it that persecutes your brethren the Christians to death, and so one Christian persecute another, and you are not in the higher Power of Christ that destroyes the Devil, but you are in that Power that hates, and you destroy the Creatures, these are the blind guides and blind Leaders and watchmen, that run at the Creatures, and should run at the power of darknesse, and these be out of the love of God to enemies, and these will wrestle with flesh and blood, be in the power of darknesse the Devils work, and so defaces the Creature, and do not bring it into the Liberty of the Sons of God, these should be ashamed of their work before the Lord, and are such as the Lord never sent, for whom he sends he Arms, makes them walls of brasse that they shall not fear the whole world, they abhor the name of a prison, or Goal, or a stock, or a whip, or cage, or an inquisition to search people, or to bring them to worship God, for these have been since men inwardly ravened from the Spirit of God which should search them; your day is come of tryal, the day is come of Christendoms tryal, by which day her works and actions are seen, and have been seen since the Apostles dayes and time.</p>
            <p>And are not you all blind, and do not you hood-winck your selves, else might you not see what confusion there is amongst your Teachers? have they not teacht you should work out your Salvation with fear and trembling, and if any come to that work, to tremble at the Word of God, then he is scofft and mockt, a nick-name is given him by the Priests and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>(A Quaker.)</hi> And have not your Priests said you should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and if any come to repent and to turn away from sin, is not he made a prey upon by you? And have not the Priests
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109879:17"/> taught that people should be taught of God, have the Law of God written in their mindes and hearts, if any come to witness this, he is as a beacon set on an hill, he is mockt and scofft at, one that denies means? And have not your Priests and you prayed that the Lord would lead them by his Spirit, and give his spirit, and if any one come to witnesse this, that he is led by the Spirit of God, that pray in the Spirit, and sing in the Spirit, and the spirit of the Father speaking in him, he is called a Blasphemer and one that is not fit to dwell upon the earth? And have not your Priests and you declared that Christ should be in people except they be Reprobates, and if any one come to witnesse Christ in him the hope of glory, the body dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of sin, and he manifest in the flesh to destroy sin in his flesh, and he through him became Gods Righteousnesse, these are the men and these are the people that are not fit to live upon the Earth, and yet you will have Taxes of them, Assesments, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize, mend Steeple-houses, pay Clerks, pay Priests treble and treble, and their goods taken away, and Horses and Cattel for going to Meetings, and they fined and Imprisoned for asking the Priest a question, and they Prisoned and their Goods spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for not paying the Church-Wardens for mending the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-house, and yet must not have the service of it, to ask the Priest a Question in it, and yet he must have treble and treble, give him treble, and he will take treble and treble; Are these like Gospel times?

            <p>YOu are to do the Nations businesse freely, and that is the way to get into the hearts of People, to answer the good and just Principle of God in them, and take away Tythes and oppression, and take away great Assesments, abate your Wages, stop persecution for Religion, Whipping, Stocking, Imprisoning and killing, That the Blood of the Innocent ye may keep off of you, which few have done before you, for which the secret Power of the Lord hath wrought and overturned them. Friends, this I say to you, <hi>Paul</hi> was never persecuted untill he came to exercise himself to have a good conscience towards God and towards man, then was he stoned, was he prisoned, then was he tossed up and down before Magistrates, and haled up and down from place to place; So when he came to the confession that he exercised himselfe to have a good conscience towards
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109879:18"/> God and towards man, then the Magistrates was against him, the Powers, the Priests, the people of the Earth, and so they do against us, when we come to exercise our selves, to have our Consciences void of offence, &amp;c. to keep it clear, then the Magistrates began to persecute against us, people to stone us, Priests to rage against us in their Pulpits, and cry to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, help, help, help, These are the men that turn the World upside down, these are the men that deny Government, as they said to Christ, this is the man that is against <hi>Cesar,</hi> and a breaker of the Law; And called <hi>Paul</hi> a pestilent fellow, a ring-leader of Sects, and charged him with Heresie for the answer of a good Conscience, but <hi>Paul</hi> answered in Wisdom and sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, saying, by that way which you call Heresie do we Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the God of our Fathers, and so do we, and if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates had nothing to do with <hi>Paul,</hi> who exercised a pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, what hath the Magistrate to do now with them that do exercise their Conscience, if the Magistrates do still persecute them that exercise their Consciences towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, they must judge <hi>Paul</hi> to be the Heretick. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this I say to you, as long as you keep the Priests up with their Tythes, with their maintenance, and feed them, ye will have trouble in the Nation, for they will be setting the people one against another; So take away their maintenance, &amp; let them that will preach freely, preach, and then you will try who is for God, and who is for <hi>Baal,</hi> for the wages of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and who is for the belly; so let them plow, and dig, and make vineyards; And let no man be persecuted for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his conscience; And keep ye low and in the power of God, and in the fear, and in his Life, or else you will be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie with those things which doth not belong to you, and you will not have an understanding to order, and govern those things which belongs to your place, and thereby come ye by that to be blinde; And such by the power of the Lord God the Lord throws out; Therefore that which would blinde your eyes, keep down, keep out, keep silent, keep sober; lay not hands upon any hastily, neither give Judgement suddenly least ye shed the Innocent blood, and that is the way to stand and prosper, for this is your time and day.</p>

            <head>Concerning Swearing; Also concerning loving Enemies; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath; concerning who are fit to bear office for Christ, and other whole somethings.</head>
            <p>CHrists Commands to his that must Rule and Judge in his Kingdom, in his Power and Authority. I say unto you sware not at all, neither by Heaven, for it is the Throne of God, nor yet by the Earth, for it is his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool; neither by <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for it is the City of the great King, neither shalt thou sware by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black; but let your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for whatsoever is more then these cometh of evil, mark, is not this the infallible way to stand, not to swear at all, but let your communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be yea and nay in all controversies and differences, Trads and exchangings, it cometh of evil if it be more then these, yea and nay, this is the Doctrine in the authority; Therefore swearing by the Bible, by the Evangelist, by the Crosse, cometh of evil, it is more then yea and nay, in the evil; So not an universall but is to be condemned, <hi>James</hi> saith, if you believe he spoke infallibly, but above all things my Brethren sware not, Mark, these were the true
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109879:23"/> Christians sware not neither by Heaven nor by Earth, nor any other oath, but let your yea be yea; mark again, &amp; your nay nay least you fall into condemnation, so ye that swear by Heaven or Earth or any other oath are fallen into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and ye that draw people to swear are in the condemnation; Therefore there is no man in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ that is a swearer, and therefore you that call your selves Christians, let no man bear office that will take an oath, for oaths cometh of evil &amp; are above yea and nay, and ye that swear are in the condemnation; now if you say the <hi>Jews</hi> swore and was to perform their oath to the Lord and swore by the Lord, yea they did so and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith thou shalt perform thy oath to the Lord, and the oath was given among them for the ending of strife, which Christ ends the Law and the strife, and redeems out of the Earth, where there need be nothing among the people but yea and nay in their communication, for all the swearing hath come from the evil, and from such as hath been in the condemnation, and would bring others since the dayes of the Apostles, some swearing by the Book, some swearing by the Crosse, some by one thing some by another, which are not worthy to be called the Ministers of Christ, nor have had no command from him, for he never set up a law nor the Apostles that there should be swearing among the Christians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do to all men as you would have them do to on and on this hangs all the Law and the Prophets, to do as you would be done by.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I say unto you, love your enemies; now the <hi>Jews</hi> was to kill them, the Heathen with the outward sword, but the Doctrine of Christ was to love enemies, who saith he comes to save mens lives, and gave his Body for the life of the World, for the <hi>Jews</hi> was them that persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their enemies, as you the Hypocrites &amp; false Christians since the dayes of the Apostles; It was said of them of old time, thou shalt hate thy enemie &amp; love thy neighbour, but I say unto you love your enemies, saith Christ, here his law and blesse them that curse you, do good to them that hate
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109879:23"/> you, and pray for them that persecute you, that you may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, that loves enemies, that you may appear to be as you have said you are under grace; Now where is the law to persecute about Religion, Church Worship, Priests Maintenance, or Ministers of the Gospel as you call them? doth not these things stink and give an evil savour, and have ye not done this since the Apostles dayes in the whole Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? so if you love them that love you, what reward have you, do not the <hi>Publicans</hi> so and the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and what singular thing do you more then they that hates, so have not the Christians love been like the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that have hated enemies, yea and one another, and so have broken the commands of Christ, and are not the Children of the most High? but ye may see how Christians have been in the <hi>Pharisees</hi> love, loved their friends, and hated their enemies, and out of the singular thing, out of the love of God and Christ, but doth even as the <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> did; therefore have they killed mens lives, not saved them, about Church-worship, as the <hi>Iews</hi> did with Christ the Son of God who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, whose Doctrine is to love enemies, and love one another, that is the command to the Christians, but they have killed one another, the Christians so called, about Church-worship, and Priests maintenance, and Religion, and so differs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from Heathen and <hi>Publicans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. One man esteemes one day above another, another man accounts every day alike, but let every man be fully perswaded in his own minde, let no man judge and set his Brother at nought about such things, much lesse persecute; but if you say thou shalt keep holy the Sabbath day, That was said to the <hi>Iews</hi> and not to the Christians, and he was to be stoned to death that did any manner of work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Let no man bear office for Christ that will not do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and judge equally a mans business without he put off his hat to him, but fine him and cast him in prison, for such God will bow &amp; overturn, let no man bear office that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109879:24"/> will respect persons, or would have his person respected, let no man bear an office that will not do it freely for the Common-wealth sake, and the Nations good; and this will be the way to stop that which will eat up the poor; nor no drunkard nor profane person, nor persecutor have the name of an officer for Christ, and let the least in the Church among all you that are called Christians judge of outward things.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And let no one be put to death for Cattel or Money, or such like Creatures, but make equall laws and Judges.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Let no man be forced to maintaine a Minister by laws and acts, &amp; hailings up to Courts, but let all them be disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, for this hath been all contrary to the minde of Christ, set up since the dayes of the Apostles, both Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and Papists.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Let there be no papists that will have their Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Goals, and stocks, and whips, nor banishments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout worship, Church Ministers, and their maintenance, which is got up since the dayes of the Apostles, which is quit contrary to Christs minde.</p>
            <p>And all Christians that you be not worse then the Turks and Heathen, among whom people may live and professe their own Religion, paying them some tribute or custom, and shall not be molested, but among you the Christians, paying you custom, excise, your taxes, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance by force for a Minister which doth no work for them, yet they are haled to Courts, and prisoned till death, and yet we are fined and imprisoned for not swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not doffing the hat, and not suffered to travel to visit one another, but taken up and whipped, and besides taken up for going to a meeting, &amp; our horses taken from us, besides our meetings broken up and our houses broken, and we knockt down, and our blood shed, our windows broken, our cloaths rent, and we stoned in the High-ways, and is a mock and scoffe to all people and a derision; and the hands of evil doers strengthened, and yet in many places compelled to go to the Steeple-house, or else fined, yet if he go thither and ask a question, fined and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109879:24"/> Now if this authority have not been worse then the Turks and the Heathens; for whether or no they would have served us so if we should have paid them custom, excise and taxes, to have maintained their poor, whether or no they would not have protected us better then these? but our protection hath been the Power of God, and whether or no the Turks &amp; Heathen would have forced us to have maintained their worshipping houses, their Clerks &amp; their Ministers, and have given them their taxes besides, and excise and customs as we do to you, whether or no in this we should have lived as slaves, and are yet among you not as free people; for all Kings, Emperors, hath got up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Christians since the dayes of the Apostles to judge of outward things, and to rule over people, whereas Christ should be the Judge, Christ should be the King, and the least of the Church should judge of outward things.</p>
